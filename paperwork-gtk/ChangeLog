2022/01/08 - 2.1.2:
- Optim: mainwindow.docproperties: optim reload doc properties only if the doc properties are actually visible (it was a huge CPU waste) (thanks to pie@#openpaperwork)
- Fix: docview: make sure the currently-active page is always the currently-highlighted one
- Fix: docview: remove an obsolete workaround preventing 'doc_goto_page()' to work correctly right after a call to 'doc_open()'
- page editor: when clicking apply, make it obvious the user may have to wait.
  Sometimes Paperwork has already jobs queued and cannot apply the changes
  immediately --> user has to wait
- mainwindow.pageview.boxes: Fix crash: in some rare cases, we may have 2 word
  boxes with the same coordinates --> when sorting the boxes by position, we
  may have to implement __lt__ on NBox.

2022/01/31 - 2.1.1:
- drop unused dependency on dateutil
- Doc deletion: Fix broken spanish translation: Wrong Python formatter has
  been used

  (drag'n'drop isn't obvious to all users)
- Mouse middle button can now be used to scroll in a document (auto-scrolling)
- Add dependency on Libhandy

2021/05/24 - 2.0.3:
- GTK: (may be important for package maintainers):
  "make data" --> "screenshot.sh": Download the test documents from a Git
  repository instead of a .tar.gz. See Gitlab issue #961.
- GTK: Doc/page export: Work around bug in Gnome platform 40 (Flatpak) (caused
  a full crash of Paperwork ; Segfault)

- add a command "paperwork-gtk import": Open the GUI and import the documents
  given as arguments (thanks to Guillaume Girol)

  so users can import files directly from their file browser (thanks to
  Guillaume Girol)

  Start the full synchronization when the GUI is started, but only if the
  configuration allows it. (Before this plugin, synchronization was started
  directly in the 'main.py')
- advanced search: prevent the user from opening the dialog twice
  (not supported)

  Once the dialog has been closed and destroy, it could not be opened correctly

  Cairo ImageSurface (some Fujitsu scanners)
- settings/storage: when opening the file chooser to select the work directory,
  pre-select the current work directory
- GTK: boxes.search: do not highlight the keywords "and" and "or".
  They are used in Whoosh query syntax, but it's useless to highlight them in
  documents.

2020/11/15 - 2.0.1:

  a Flatpak container, show a popup to the user explaining how to enable and
  configure Saned.

2017/08/26 - 1.2.1:

2017/02/09 - 1.1.2:

  is being search)
- Optim: Document list: Only display display the first 100 elements of the
  list, and extend it only when required. Reduces GTK latency
  (GtkListBox doesn't scale very well above 100 elements).
- Optim: Improve PDF rendering speed: Let the libpoppler take care of the
  rendering size (see backend:page.get_image())
- Optim: Reduce the number of useless calls to redraw()
