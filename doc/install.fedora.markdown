# Paperwork installation on GNU/Linux Fedora

## Packages

This is the recommended method of installation.

A package is available in [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/).

```sh
sudo dnf install paperwork
```

Once installed, you can run `paperwork-cli chkdeps`
and `paperwork-gtk chkdeps` to make sure all the required
depencies are installed.

You can start Paperwork with the command `paperwork-gtk`.


## Flatpak

If you want more up-to-date versions of Paperwork, you can install it
[using Flatpak](install.flatpak.markdown). Just beware that those versions of
Paperwork come directly from Paperwork developers themselves and haven't been
reviewed by the Fedora package maintainer(s).
