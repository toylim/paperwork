# Introduction

Flatpak is a package manager for Linux. It is available on all major GNU/Linux
distributions. It also keeps applications and all their dependencies inside
containers, making them easy to update and uninstall.

Its advantages:

- You get the latest version of Paperwork, directly from its developers.
- Paperwork remains nicely packaged. It won't make a mess on your system.

Its drawback:

- Using Flatpak, Paperwork comes directly from its developers. It has not been
  reviewed by your distribution maintainers. It may not include some changes
  that your distribution maintainers would have added.
- Scanners are harder to setup
- Accessing files outside of your home directory requires some extra manipulations

# Quick start

## Installing Flatpak

* GNU/Linux Debian: `sudo apt install flatpak`
* GNU/Linux Fedora: `sudo dnf install flatpak`


## Installing Paperwork

```sh
# Install Paperwork (for the current user only)
# <branch> can be:
# - 'master': stable branch (latest release + some bug fixes)
# - 'testing': stabilization branch
# - 'develop': development branch (new untested features)
flatpak --user install https://builder.openpaper.work/paperwork_<branch>.flatpakref

# For example:
flatpak --user install https://builder.openpaper.work/paperwork_master.flatpakref
```

Flatpak will add a Paperwork icon in your menus. You may have to log out and
log back in to see it.

Alternatively, you can start Paperwork from a terminal:

```sh
flatpak run work.openpaper.Paperwork
```


## Allowing Paperwork to access scanners

IMPORTANT: Paperwork in Flatpak uses Saned to access scanners, and Saned
gives access only to local scanners (non-network scanner). If you want to use
a network scanner, you will have to install Paperwork from your Linux
distribution packages or [from sources](install.devel.markdown).

When installed using Flatpak, Paperwork runs in a container. This container prevents
Paperwork from accessing devices directly. Therefore the scanning daemon
[Saned](https://linux.die.net/man/1/saned) must be enabled on the host system,
and connection must be allowed from 127.0.0.1.

Instructions can be found in the settings of Paperwork:

![Flatpak + Saned instructions: Step 2](flatpak_saned_2.png)
![Flatpak + Saned instructions: Step 3](flatpak_saned_3.png)

If after a reboot your scanner is still not found, please see the FAQ below.


## Updating Paperwork

```sh
flatpak --user update work.openpaper.Paperwork
```

# FAQ

## Even after following the integrated instructions, my scanner is still not found

For some scanners, extra work is required to make them available to Paperwork
in Flatpak. It usually comes down to a permission problem: the Saned daemon
doesn't have the permissions to access your scanner.


### Debian or Ubuntu

The simplest solution is to run Saned as the very same user as you.

```sh
sudo sh -c "echo RUN_AS_USER=$(whoami) > /etc/default/saned"
sudo reboot
```

### Other distributions

You must add specific udev rules.

For example, with a Canon Lide 30:

```console
$ lsusb
(...)
Bus 003 Device 008: ID 04a9:220e Canon, Inc. CanoScan N1240U/LiDE 30
(...)
```

`04a9` is the vendor ID. `220e` is the product ID.
The following command will add and enable the required udev rule. You must
just change the idVendor and the idProduct in it.

```sh
sudo sh -c "echo 'ATTRS{idVendor}==\"04a9\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"220e\", MODE=\"0666\"' > /lib/udev/rules.d/10-my-scanner.rules"
sudo systemctl restart udev
```

Then, you can either disconnect or reconnect your scanner, or reboot your
computer.

Beware the udev rule above is quite large and will allow any user on your
computer to use your scanner.


## No text appears when rendering PDF files. What do I do ?

If you run Paperwork from a terminal, you can see the message
`some font thing has failed` every time you open a PDF file from Paperwork.
This issue is related to fontconfig cache.

To fix it:

- Stop Paperwork
- Run: `flatpak run --command=fc-cache work.openpaper.Paperwork -f`


## How do I run paperwork-cli / paperwork-json ?

When using Flatpak, paperwork-cli is also available. Note that it will run
inside Paperwork's container and cannot access files outside your home
directory.

```sh
flatpak run --command=paperwork-cli work.openpaper.Paperwork [args]
flatpak run --command=paperwork-cli work.openpaper.Paperwork --help
```

Examples:

```sh
flatpak run --command=paperwork-cli work.openpaper.Paperwork help import
flatpak run --command=paperwork-cli work.openpaper.Paperwork -bq import ~/tmp/pdf
```

## Installing support for additional languages

By default, Flatpak installs support for English and the language of your
system. If you want support for additional languages, you can use the following
commands:

```sh
flatpak config --user --set languages "en;fr;de"
flatpak update --user
```

To get support for all the languages supported by Tesseract (OCR):

```sh
flatpak install --reinstall --user work.openpaper.Paperwork.Locale
```


## What about i386 and ARM architectures ?

[Continous integration](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/paperwork/pipelines)
only builds Paperwork for amd64 (aka x86\_64). If you want to run Paperwork
on i386 or ARM systems, you can use the
[Flathub version](https://flathub.org/apps/details/work.openpaper.Paperwork).

If you don't know what architecture your computer is based and if your computer
has more than 2GB of RAM, it is probably compatible with amd64.


## How do I update The GPG public key of the Flatpak repository ?

Paperwork repository GPG key expires every 2 years. When that happens, when you
try updating Paperwork, you will get an output similar to the following one:

```
$ flatpak --user update
Looking for updatesâ€¦
F: Error updating remote metadata for 'paperwork-origin': GPG signatures found, but none are in trusted keyring
F: Warning: Treating remote fetch error as non-fatal since runtime/work.openpaper.Paperwork.Locale/x86_64/master is already installed: Unable to load summary from remote paperwork-origin: GPG signatures found, but none are in trusted keyring
F: Warning: Can't find runtime/work.openpaper.Paperwork.Locale/x86_64/master metadata for dependencies: Unable to load metadata from remote paperwork-origin: summary fetch error: GPG signatures found, but none are in trusted keyring

F: Warning: Can't find app/work.openpaper.Paperwork/x86_64/master metadata for dependencies: Unable to load metadata from remote paperwork-origin: summary fetch error: GPG signatures found, but none are in trusted keyring
(...)

Error: GPG signatures found, but none are in trusted keyring
Error: GPG signatures found, but none are in trusted keyring
Changes complete.
error: There were one or more errors
```

The simplest way to fix that is to reinstall Paperwork. Uninstalling Paperwork
will never delete your documents.

```
flatpak --user remove work.openpaper.Paperwork
flatpak --user remote-delete paperwork-origin
flatpak --user install https://builder.openpaper.work/paperwork_master.flatpakref
```


# Build

Here are the instructions if you want to try to build the Flatpak version
yourself.

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/paperwork.git
cd paperwork/flatpak
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists gnome https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome.flatpakrepo
flatpak --user install gnome org.gnome.Sdk//3.26
flatpak --user install gnome org.gnome.Platform//3.26
make
```
