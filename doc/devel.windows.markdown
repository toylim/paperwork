# Paperwork development on Windows


## Build dependencies

It's hard to list all the dependencies here. Currently, the main ones are:

* [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
* Windows SDK7.1 : See [Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers#Microsoft_Visual_C.2B-.2B-_10.0_standalone:_Windows_SDK_7.1_.28x86.2C_x64.2C_ia64.29)
* [Windows DDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800) (for Pyinsane ; required only if the no Python wheel is available)
* [Pillow](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow)
* [Python-levenshtein](www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-levenshtein)
* [GObject Introspection, Gtk, Gdk, Libpoppler, & friends](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/)
* Msys2 or Mingw shell
* GNU Makefile

They must be installed *before* the rest of Paperwork. Once everything is installed:

* [Clone](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) ```https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/paperwork.git```
* You can run ```make install``` (GNU Makefile) to fetch all the Python dependencies
  not listed here. However, it won't create any shortcut or anything. Paperwork startup script
  is installed, but isn't of much help.


## Running


Go to where you checked out Paperwork frontend,
and run ```python paperwork\src\launcher.py```. Tesseract must be in your PATH.


## Packaging

```
cd git\paperwork
make windows_exe
```

It should create a directory 'paperwork' with all the required files, except Tesseract.
This directory can be stored in a .zip file and deploy wherever you wish.


## Adding Tesseract

[PyOCR](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/pyocr) has 2 ways to call
Tesseract. Either
by running its executable (module ```pyocr.tesseract```), or using its library
(module ```pyocr.libtesseract```). Currently, for convenience reasons, the
packaged version of Paperwork uses only ```pyocr.tesseract```.

By default, this module looks for tesseract in the PATH only, and let Tesseract
look for its data files in the default location. However, when packaged with
Pyinstaller, PyOCR will also look for tesseract in the subdirectory ```tesseract```
of the current directory (```os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'tesseract')```). It will
also set an environment variable so Tesseract looks for its data files in
the subdirectory ```data\tessdata```.

So in the end, you can put Paperwork in a directory with the following hierarchy:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenPaper\ (for example)
|-- Paperwork\ (for example)
    |
    |-- Paperwork.exe
    |-- (...).dll
    |
    |-- Tesseract\
    |   |-- Tesseract.exe
    |   |-- (...).dll
    |
    |-- Data
        |
        |-- paperwork.svg
        |-- (...)
        |
        |-- Tessdata\
            |-- eng.traineddata
            |-- fra.traineddata
```

Note that it will only work if packaged with Pyinstaller.
