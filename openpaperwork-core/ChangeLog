2020/11/15 - 2.0.1:
- Bug report censoring: Take into account that some strings in the logs may be
  URL-encoded and censor them too (for instance, path to the user home
  directory)
- fault handler: Prefer dumping the output of faulthandler in the log file
  instead of stderr (can't do both inforunately)
- Logs archive + bug report: by default, report the logs of the last 2 previous
  sessions too
- fs.python: Text files must be encoded in UTF-8
- Windows packaging: Fix HTTPS support: Use the certifi module to provide root
  certificates
- Include tests in Pypi package (thanks to Elliott Sales de Andrade)

2020/10/17 - 2.0:
