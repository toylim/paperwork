This is the backend part of Paperwork. It manages:
- The work directory / Access to the documents
- Indexing
- Searching
- Suggestions
- Import
- Export

There is no GUI here. The GUI is located here: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/OpenPaperwork/paperwork/tree/master/paperwork-gtk .

Regarding the name "Paperwork", it can refer to both the GUI or the backend. If you want to be specific, you can call the gui "paperwork-gtk" instead of just Paperwork.
