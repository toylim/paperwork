2019/08/17 - 1.3.0:
- PDF export: PDFs can now be regenerated when exporting. Regenerated versions
  will include words from the OCR, but some metadata may be lost.
- Optimization: Speed up conversions from PIL image to GdkPixbuf (used for
  export previews and thumbnail display)
- Disable the use of a dedicated process for index operations: it
  prevents debugging
- New dependency: Do not use platform.dist() or platform.linux_distribution()
  anymore: It's deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.8. Use instead the
  module 'distro'.
- paperwork-shell: Add name and label arguments to command 'import' (thanks to
  Stéphane Brunner)
- Backend: Fix importing PNG files with transparency (thanks to Balló György)
- Fix warnings related to regexes escaping + various other cleanups (thanks
  to Elliott Sales de Andrade)

2018/03/01 - 1.2.4:
- Import: Remove ambiguity: Importers designed for import of directory
  will not try to import individual files. They will just let the importers
  designed for importing single file take care of it.
- Label guessing: Fix the way bayesian filters are updated (will trigger an
  index rebuild).
- paperwork-shell/labels/guessing: return scores as well as labels
  (useful for testing/debuging)
- Optim: PDF: Keep in memory the page sizes. It's an information very often
  requested when rendering and it cannot change with PDFs

2018/02/01 - 1.2.3:
- Windows: Fix labels handling: Fix CSV file reading
- Fix global deletion of a label
- Flatpak: Fix deletion of documents
- PDF: Fix file descriptor leak
- Flatpak: Fix support on English systems

2017/11/14 - 1.2.2:
- PDF: Fix thumbnail sizes. Incorrect thumbnails will be automatically
  regenerated

2017/08/26 - 1.2.1:
- paperwork-shell: improve help string of 'paperwork-shell chkdeps'
- Fix label deletion / renaming
- Windows: Fix FS.safe() when used for PDF import
- Windows: Fix FS.unsafe() (used for PDF export)

2017/07/11 - 1.2.0:
- API: remove methods doc.drop_cache() and page.drop_cache()
- API: docsearch: add method close()
- paperwork-shell: Use JSON format for the output (except for 'paperwork-shell
  dump')
- Use GIO functions instead of Python functions (open(), read(), close(), etc)
- Use URIs instead of Unix file paths (file:///...)
- Index is now managed in a separate process (avoid Python GIL locking + UI
  freezes)
- Import: Make it possible to import image folder
- Importers: provide a list of supported file formats (mime types)
- Import: To figure out a file type, look at the file extensions but also the
  mime type in case the extension is not set
- Import: Make the importers able to handle multiple Files/URIs instead of just
  one
- paperwork-shell import: Run OCR on imported pages that have no words
- paperwork-shell: add command 'ocr'
- Configuration: [Global]:workdirectory is now an URI encoded in base64
  (base64 encoding was required due to limitations of Python's ConfigParser)
- DocSearch: When unable to open the index, destroy it and rebuild it from scratch
- Add a new document type: ExternalPdfDoc: Used to display PDF that are outside
  of the work directory (for instance application help manual)
- Configuration setting [OCR]:lang is now managed by the backend instead of
  the frontend

2017/02/09 - 1.1.2:
- PDF: When PdfDoc.drop_cache() is called, make sure *all* the references to
  the Poppler objects are dropped, including those to the pages of the document

2017/02/05 - 1.1.1:
- No change. Version created only to match Paperwork-gui version.

2017/01/30 - 1.1.0:
- Add methods doc.has_ocr() and page.has_ocr() indicating if OCR has already
  been run on a given doc/page or not yet.
  Used in GUI for the option "Redo OCR on all documents" as it must act only
  on documents where OCR has already been done in the past (ie not PDF with
  text included)
- Optim: Provides a method page.get_image() returning an already resized
  Pillow image (PDF rendering optimisation)
- Export: Report progression
- Optim: PDF thumbnail rendering: Keep a cached version of the first page only.
  The other pages can be rendered on the fly
- Fix: Label directory name use base64 encoding, and this encoding can result
  in strings containing '/'. Those characters must be replaced (by '_')
- Fix: util/find_language(): If the system locale is not set properly, pycountry
  may raise UnicodeDecodeError.
- paperwork-shell: Add commands 'search', 'dump', 'switch_workdir', 'rescan',
  'show', 'import', 'delete_doc', 'guess_labels', 'add_label', 'remove_label',
  'rename'
- Import: When importing a single PDF, don't import it if it was already
  previously imported
- Import: Provides detailed information and statistics regarding what has been
  imported (return value of Importer.import_doc() has changed)

1.0.6:
- No change. Version created only to match Paperwork-gui version.

1.0.5:
- Doc deletion: Drop cache and file descripts *before* deleting document
(optional on GNU/Linux, but required on Windows)

1.0.4:
- Windows: Fix image import

1.0.3:
- Windows: Fix import/export

1.0.2:
- No change. Version created only to match Paperwork-gui version.

1.0.1:
- util/find_language(): fix pycountry db lookup
- Windows: hide ~/.config instead of ~/.config/paperwork.conf
